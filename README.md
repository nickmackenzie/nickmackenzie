### Hi, I'm Nick MacKenzie 🙋‍♂️

**Who? 🤔**

I am a recent General Assembly graduate from the Software Engineering Immersive program. This has given me the knowledge to be proficient in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
I am a meticulous, driven, and creative thinker who has worked professionally in both team and independent settings for the last ten years.
